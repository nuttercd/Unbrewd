# Unbrewd: Drink coffee with confidence

Unbrewd is an app like Untappd, but for coffee.

This app was created using the `npx @capacitor/cli create` command, and comes with a very
minimal shell for building an app.

Note: unless you know what you're doing, we don't recommend using the `create` way of building an app. Instead, you'll
likely want to create an app using your framework's tooling (such as `create-react-app`), and then *add* capacitor
to *that* project (using `npx @capacitor/cli init`).

## Running this example

To run the provided example, can use serve command:

```bash
npx cap serve
```

Steps for setting up:
```npm install --save @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core```
```npm run build```
```npx cap update android```

How to run: ```npx cap open android```
